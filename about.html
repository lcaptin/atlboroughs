          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Atlantans are all individually representing our city publically to friends, family, and acquaintances - this includes the 90% of population who are living in the metro area. Often times visits to the city for this portion of the population stop shy of  visits to the individual neighborhoods that really represent the culture and lifestyle in Atlanta.<br><br>
              This creates a perception of a lack of culture in Atlanta that is frustratingly inaccurate - and this perception can be toxic when it results in a higher number of top caliber graduates from local universities leaving Atlanta for an all too commonly cited reason – a lack of culture in Atlanta.<br><br>
              This problem is also prevalent for individuals who do live locally in the city of Atlanta. Atlanta is organized around 26 “Neighborhood Planning Units” (NPU) that Atlantan’s do not identify well with, and the 242 neighborhoods the NPU’s are broken down into are so granular it is a bit overwhelming. (Ref: http://atlantaga.gov/index.aspx?page=404)<br><br>
              ATL Boroughs is re-writing the boundaries of the neighborhoods around groups of communities that locals identify well with, and calling these communities boroughs. These boroughs do not necessarily align with official government boundaries, and are not all inclusive.
              By visiting our site, and encouraging individuals to comple a number of day trips and adventures to gain exposure to the real destinations in Atlanta - we hope to create a form of “Atlanta Certification” for individuals to hold before representing Atlanta publically.
